					"{@bold Scourge of the Skies.} Above the prehistoric jungles of chult, the kravgaera thrive and dominate, controlling the skies with a tyrannical scream. The ear-piercing shriek of these apex predators is enough to clear out entire populations of birds and pterosaurs, allowing them to scatter prey easily and claim territory with little to no competition. These bold predators will even battle large terrestrial animals for territory and are even known to prey on the occasional elephant or hadrosaur. These predators are covered in a thick, serrated carapace that allows them to burrow by writhing and “swimming” through the earth. They utilize their burrowing ability by transitioning to earth and sky rapidly, disorienting prey. These emperors of the sky even manage to hold their own against dragons, although they can’t survive a prolonged battle. As a result, these normally solitary and territorial creatures may band together to bully the magical reptiles out of the sky, thus condemning most dragons to the ground.",
					"{@bold Blind Fliers.} Most sentient creatures think bats to be completely blind, navigating through keen senses and subsonic vibrations. Whilst this is simply misinformation, the kravgaera are truly blind, locating prey through echolocation and navigating via an internal GPS system, which is yet to be truly understood. It is theorized that, due to the creature’s vulnerability to electromagnesis, the kravgaera have an innate organ covered in specialized photoreceptors that allows the reptile to sense the planet’s Geomagnetism, similar to birds. However, this has yet to be proven, as the jungles of Chult rarely preserve the bodies of the dead, which are either scavenged or reanimated. Watching the rotting corpse of a zombified kravgaera soar through the tropical sky is an eerie sight, and it’s of the watcher’s best interest to hide before they are spotted.",
					"{@bold Sonic Screams.} The screams of a kravgaera can be summarized by two words; loud and dangerous. These ear-splitting pterosaurs are capable of shrieking loud enough to emit powerful bursts of sound, acting as a concentrated explosion when colliding with a physical surface. These concentrated blasts are devastating to both organic and inorganic material, capable of causing severe physical damage and even destroying terrain. While deadly to potential prey and would-be predators, these sonic bursts are most devastating to other kravgaera, overloading their senses and causing them to plummet to the ground. It isn’t uncommon to find rival males nimbly evading each other, firing powerful shockwaves at one another before one is sent cascading to the jungle floor below, leaving only one to be the true emperor of the skies.

					"{@italic As the surrounding blizzard persisted mercilessly, two young goliaths trekked through the rock and snow. As stubborn as they were, they were unwilling to admit that they were lost, miles away from their mountainous village. As the pair stopped for a brief rest, a deep, grumbling roar pierced the shrieking winds. To their horror, the silhouette of an ogre loomed just meters away from them, wielding a colossal tree trunk. Exhausted and sore, the two goliaths gripped their weapons tightly, readying themselves for their final battle. As the ogre charged, the two goliaths let out a triumphant war cry which, to their surprise, was overtaken by an echoing draconic roar that carried for miles. From behind, the two goliaths felt an intense heat grace their backs, melting the frost and snow. They watched as a massive, winged figure leapt high above their heads before crashing atop the bewildered ogre. The ape-like creature subjected the troll-kin to a flurry of devastating blows, shattering its bones like paper. With a ferocious, bellowing roar, the ogre was lifted high above the beast’s head and effortlessly thrown to the jagged rocks below. Both impressed and terrified, the two goliaths looked on in awe as the creature turned to them and bowed its head before unfurling its massive wings and taking flight, vanishing from sight in a swarm of embers.}",
					"A legendary creature of both draconic and simian descent, the Gargoyle is a savior to those lost in the desolate, frozen mountains that it calls home.",
					"{@bold Mysterious Origins.} The circumstances in which the Gargoyle was born is considered a mystery by all, as its unique combination of both draconic and hominid traits is, as far as most are concerned, completely irreproducible. It is heavily speculated that the creature is a half-dragon of sorts, but the manner in which it was conceived is unknown. Nonetheless, the Gargoyle combines the traits of a silverback gorilla and a red dragon to devastating effect. Covered in both the muscular, impenetrable hide of a dragon and the shaggy, warming fur of an ape, the Gargoyle is, for an unknown reason, mostly gray, resembling a stone statue. The only touch of color present on the massive creature is its massive, leathery wings, in which its membrane is a darkened crimson. The Gargoyle earned its name due to these wings, its bestial humanoid physique, the concrete-like appearance of its hide, and its long, dragon-like tail that ends in a devilish point.",
					"{@bold Chimeric Personality.} Similarly to its appearance, the Gargoyle’s personality is tainted by draconic habit. The beast shares a fondness of mountains with its reptilian parent, preferring to lair at high altitudes. It shares a dragon’s greed, collecting trinkets and other items that it considers to be valuable, which are often playthings. It collects wagon wheels, tree trunks, boulders, and even other animals. It’s extremely fond of large grazing animals such as yaks and elk. The Gargoyle is omnivorous, although it prefers to live a more herbivorous lifestyle, grazing with its “troop” and protecting them ferociously. While normally docile and playful, if the Gargoyle encounters anything it perceives as a threat to itself or its troop, it will attack with unexpected levels of primal aggression, combining the blazing fury of a red dragon and the frightening strength of a gorilla. Its mastery of flame surpasses its parent’s, allowing it to wreathe itself in scorching embers."

					"{@bold Radioactive Titan.} Closely related to a smaller genus of innately radioactive spinosaurids, Violothéos has grown to a massive size through unknown means. Some claim that the beast is a close relative of the tarrasque, but given its close ties to a separate, smaller species, it may be safe to assume that this is not the case. It is widely believed that the beast was mutated by overexposure to arcane radiation, which it exerts a peculiar mastery over. Violothéos’ signature weapon is its “atomic breath,” nuclear energy that it generates inside of its body, harnessing electromagnetic force to concentrate it into a laser-like high velocity projectile. The energy is released in the form of a pink radioactive beam, which is capable of melting and vaporizing anything it comes into contact with. Through a similar method, Violothéos can exhale a wave of lethal radiation, irradiating anything it passes through. It is capable of both bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion, although it primarily moves quadrupedally whilst moving terrestrially. Two tusks at the tip of its jaw allow it to grasp and pierce more effectively, along with its peculiar ability to unhinge its jaw similar to a snake. The lizard is naturally immune to extreme heat, cold, radiation, and most forms of conventional weaponry, making it a true force of ultimate calamity. ",

When the planet is faced with global annihilation, the Violothéos will awaken, using its atomic might to topple any foe. When active, Violothéos will remain indifferent to and oftentimes completely ignore all smaller life, regarding them as a warrior would a mere ant. This can prove to be destructive at times, causing Violothéos to lay waste to villages and cities along its journey. ",
					"{@bold Misunderstood Defender.} Oftentimes, a powerful city or hold will use magic to retaliate against Violothéos. While the massive reptile is naturally resistant to the arcane, it is not immune. If sufficiently damaged, Violothéos will defend itself, targeting the attackers and casting them into oblivion with its atomic fury. This usually leads to further destruction, which causes many to resent Violothéos, assuming it to be a malevolent force.

Bears, mammoths, tigers, wolves, the forest is a terrifying place that invokes a primal sense of fear so great that only the bravest few dare to venture inside. Shriekers utilizes this crippling fear to their advantage, preying on the frightened and isolated, feeding into their paranoia before finally striking while the creature is paralyzed with terror. }",
					"{@bold Aberrant Predators.} While shriekers appear to be avian in appearance, these creatures have an alien anatomy that is more similar to an arthropod than any vertebrate. They rely on what can only be considered biological machinery to function, as their physiology is extremely complex and borderline unnatural. As a result, these creatures are capable of abilities that appear to be supernatural. Shriekers have two specialized chitinous organs extending from their backs that can emit a cloud of a nontoxic bleaching compound that absorbs direct sunlight, blackening the area around it. This compound spreads through the air like ink in water, blotting out any light in the area. Shriekers use this compound to trap terrified prey in a cloud of darkness, toying with them before ultimately delivering the killing blow with their unusually shaped beaks. These beaks are quite peculiar, consisting of a powerful, armored upper jaw and a much narrower lower jaw that splits into two serrated mandibles when opened fully. It is unknown what the purpose of this adaptation is.",
					"{@bold Forest Dwellers.} Shriekers reside in dense temperate rainforests, claiming massive territories of thick forestland. They prefer areas where the canopy blots out sunlight, darkening the forest floor in a permanent shade of gray. They specialize in preying on skittish creatures, tormenting prey with their multiple adaptations before pouncing on them when they are at their most vulnerable. They prefer to ambush their prey, as they are quite cowardly in a one-on-one fight. By no means does this make them incapable of defending themselves, however, as they are capable of quickly turning the tables on would-be predators when cornered, utilizing their darkening compound to devastating effect. Shriekers are primarily solitary, but occasionally hunt in groups of two or three, although these hunting groups are extremely uncooperative and often form temporarily in order to take down larger prey.",
					"{@bold Sound-Oriented.} Shriekers are known for their incredible mastery of sound, utilizing it for a number of various uses. Shriekers can map the surrounding environment entirely through echolocation, achieving this by opening a flap on the base of their skull, which contains an inner organ that acts similarly to an extremely sensitive eardrum. This enables them to pick up the slightest soundwaves with ease, allowing them to pinpoint the exact location of any sound in the surrounding area. They can produce powerful bursts of ear-piercing noise, shrieking loud enough to deal damage to their surroundings. Perhaps most peculiar, however, is their extended use of infrasound. By emitting inaudibly low frequencies, they can cause extreme paranoia and panic in most organisms, allowing them to trigger an ambush easily. Additionally, they can cause blindness in some creatures and deafen others simply by tampering with chemicals in the victim’s brain. They often provoke hallucinations in their prey, causing affected creatures to see illusionary duplicates of the shrieker that allow it to guide and herd the prey deeper into its hunting grounds."

A lost dolphin, separated from its pod, approaches the light, charmed by its rhythmic movements. Enchanted by the dancing orb, it doesn’t notice as several patches of eerie blue illuminate a massive creature poised directly behind the light. As crackling electricity dances around the bio-luminescent beast, the dolphin is too late to escape as the lure is extinguished and a massive pair of jaws come lunging toward it from the darkness.}",
					"{@bold Darkness Dwellers.} The abyssal-dwelling luminous eel is a massive beast, reaching lengths of 20 feet on average. Most of their lives are spent in the darkest depths of the ocean or in lightless sea caves, hunting anything it perceives to be edible. The eels only venture to the surface twice in their lifetimes, and exclusively during violent oceanic storms. The first journey occurs just after an individual reaches sexual maturity, leading the eels to flock to beaches and coastal habitats in order to breed. It is generally during this event that most attacks occur, as large, dominant males will attack anything that it senses to be a threat. Rival males will strike each other with their long, lashing tails, attempting to knock each other into submission. The victor of these battles will then put on a glorious bio-luminescent display in order to attract a mate. After mating, females will devour the males and remain on the coast before returning to the sea at the storm’s conclusion. Roughly seven to eight months later, the females, having grown even larger than the males at this point in their lives, will return to the beach at which they mated, travelling inland to lay eggs and hunt. They prefer to find places with high levels of static electricity to lay their clutch. After laying, the eels will remain around the coast until the storm ends, at which point they will venture back into the ocean to die. The newborn eels will hatch roughly a week later, returning to the sea in order to begin the cycle anew.",
					"{@bold Electrogenic Hunters:} Luminous eels prefer to hunt similarly to anglerfish, enthralling potential prey with their dancing lure before striking when the target is effectively harmless. The bio-luminescent organs lining their bodies also act similarly to the specialized organs of an electric eel (Main organ, Sachs’ organ, and Hunter’s organ), allowing for electroreception, electrolocation, and, to a much more intense extent, electrocution. The eel channels static electricity via the sodium-potassium exchanger, which maintains a voltage imbalance between the inside of the eel’s cells and their surroundings. The exchanger is said to be “electrogenic” because it removes three sodium ions for every two ions of potassium it allows in. The eel’s bio-luminescent organs have the highest concentration of electrolyte exchangers, with an uneven distribution throughout the rest of its body. Luminous eels have several thousand of these exchanger cells stacked atop one another, capable of a discharge of over 900 V.",
					"{@bold Rogue Males:} When most members of the species are breeding, a select few male individuals will travel too far in search of a mate, eventually getting trapped inland as the storm passes. These rogue males aren’t slaughtered by their mates and are thus left to grow and hunt as they please. These eels lair in coastal caves with various pools of water readily available to allow for easy access to the sea. Transitioning to a more terrestrial lifestyle, these rogue males claim large territories, ranging anywhere from 20 to 40 square miles. They defend these territories ferociously, patrolling them vigilantly. They are nocturnal predators, behaving similarly to will-o-wisps. They will lure unsuspecting travelers and other creatures close enough to be shocked and devoured. In fact, in areas where will-o’-wisps are present, the rogue males will often mistake their lights for a challenging male, charging towards the tiny undead with immense prejudice. "

An omnivore of incredible size, these scavengers prefer to feed on dead vegetation, but make use of whatever edible matter they come across."

					"Commonly referred to as Church Grims, ubiystovs are large wolverines that commonly inhabit graveyards due to their habit of scavenging on the dead.

There is even a confirmed report of a particularly violent individual bringing down a white dragon, though this is considered a unique and extremely unlikely outcome. To sate their gluttonous nature, however, ubiystovs often lair in humanoid cemeteries, digging up corpses in the dead of night to eat bones and all. These animals would be considered dangerous pests if it weren’t for their particular and violent hatred for the undead. When the rotting walk once again, a ubiystov will fly into a terrific, bloodthirsty rage until the corpse has been shredded and devoured. Many undeath-opposers utilize ubiystovs to counter undead threats for this reason.",
					"\tSurprisingly, the closest-living relative to the ubiystov isn’t the wolverine, but the savager. Larger, stronger, and bulkier, savagers are clearly the dominant animal when the two encounter one another, though savagers are known to actively avoid ubiystovs for their significantly more rabid disposition.
