Unlike most other beasts, the brachydios sports a pair of long, highly developed forelimbs that it uses as its primary means of defense. Their “fists” and horns secrete a volatile, incendiary slime.",
					"A Brachydios \"primes\" this mucus to explode with its saliva, causing it to lick its arms compulsively before attacking. When primed, the slime glows a bright green and emits harsh levels of heat. Despite initial appearances, the brachydios does possess claws on its forearms that are tucked away underneath, and are used to forage and grasp.",
					"The symbiotic slime-mold is easily one of the most unique and defining features of the brachydios. The theropod's armored shell is hardened to protect against the explosive blasts that the mold creates on impact. A brachydios' skin is similar to that of a thermos flask, giving it the ability to withstand both extreme heat and cold. A brachydios' body is the only place this mold can survive without becoming explosive. When attacking, a brachydios will obsessively scrape copious amounts of this mold off of its body, causing it to deplete. However, it seems that the beast's saliva acts as a powerful stimulant, which causes the mold to almost instantly replenish itself.",
					"Brachydios are extremely aggressive creatures and will not hesitate to attack if they feel threatened or challenged. Due to their aggression they are commonly known to invade the territories of other large predators, usurp them, and claim the territory as their own. Additionally, they will show absolutely no mercy to smaller, weaker creatures. Young will live near their parents and their territory, yet the adults will not show any parental care at all. The young will pick up slime mold left behind by adults, attaching it to their carapace. However, this can prove  to be dangerous as their hides are underdeveloped and can accidentally trigger an explosion, causing the young brachydios to be seriously injured or even killed by the explosion produced."

It will often rush any chosen prey before delivering a flurry of rending bites with its powerful, bone-crushing jaws, tearing flesh from nutritious, rich bone. Residing underneath the surface, the odogaron consumes what it can find, filling a similar niche to a vulture. However, it will occasionally venture to the surface in search of prey, where it assumes an apex role in the food chain alongside the likes of organisms such as Legiana.",

If provoked, an odogaron will fight to the death, no matter how dangerous or intimidating the encountered force is. Brasher individuals are even willing to attack adult dragons despite essentially confronting a primordial force. As a result of its neutral nature, some sentient underdark civilizations have managed to tame a few members of the species, utilizing them as swift, deadly mounts."

The ear-piercing shriek of these apex predators is enough to clear out entire populations of birds and pterosaurs, allowing them to scatter prey easily and claim territory with little to no competition. These bold predators will even battle large terrestrial animals for territory and are even known to prey on the occasional elephant or hadrosaur. These predators are covered in a thick, serrated carapace that allows them to burrow by writhing and “swimming” through the earth. They utilize their burrowing ability by transitioning to earth and sky rapidly, disorienting prey. These emperors of the sky even manage to hold their own against dragons, although they can’t survive a prolonged battle. As a result, these normally solitary and territorial creatures may band together to bully the magical reptiles out of the sky, thus condemning most dragons to the ground.",

Whilst this is simply misinformation, the kravgaera are truly blind, locating prey through echolocation and navigating via an internal GPS system, which is yet to be truly understood. It is theorized that, due to the creature’s vulnerability to electromagnesis, the kravgaera have an innate organ covered in specialized photoreceptors that allows the reptile to sense the planet’s Geomagnetism, similar to birds. However, this has yet to be proven, as the jungles of Chult rarely preserve the bodies of the dead, which are either scavenged or reanimated. Watching the rotting corpse of a zombified kravgaera soar through the tropical sky is an eerie sight, and it’s of the watcher’s best interest to hide before they are spotted.",
					"{@bold Sonic Screams.} The screams of a kravgaera can be summarized by two words; loud and dangerous. These ear-splitting pterosaurs are capable of shrieking loud enough to emit powerful bursts of sound, acting as a concentrated explosion when colliding with a physical surface. These concentrated blasts are devastating to both organic and inorganic material, capable of causing severe physical damage and even destroying terrain. While deadly to potential prey and would-be predators, these sonic bursts are most devastating to other kravgaera, overloading their senses and causing them to plummet to the ground. It isn’t uncommon to find rival males nimbly evading each other, firing powerful shockwaves at one another before one is sent cascading to the jungle floor below, leaving only one to be the true emperor of the skies.

Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety. Indeed, cryoceroses endure much provocation before they decide to act, but they run at and spear or crush those who irritate them. Once their ire is up, they rarely give up pursuing the source of their anger; only by leaving their vast territories can one hope to escape them."

Because of this, most tribes who train cryoceroses use the creatures as beasts of burden rather than war mounts."

As stubborn as they were, they were unwilling to admit that they were lost, miles away from their mountainous village. As the pair stopped for a brief rest, a deep, grumbling roar pierced the shrieking winds. To their horror, the silhouette of an ogre loomed just meters away from them, wielding a colossal tree trunk. Exhausted and sore, the two goliaths gripped their weapons tightly, readying themselves for their final battle. As the ogre charged, the two goliaths let out a triumphant war cry which, to their surprise, was overtaken by an echoing draconic roar that carried for miles. From behind, the two goliaths felt an intense heat grace their backs, melting the frost and snow. They watched as a massive, winged figure leapt high above their heads before crashing atop the bewildered ogre. The ape-like creature subjected the troll-kin to a flurry of devastating blows, shattering its bones like paper. With a ferocious, bellowing roar, the ogre was lifted high above the beast’s head and effortlessly thrown to the jagged rocks below. Both impressed and terrified, the two goliaths looked on in awe as the creature turned to them and bowed its head before unfurling its massive wings and taking flight, vanishing from sight in a swarm of embers.}",
					"A legendary creature of both draconic and simian descent, the Gargoyle is a savior to those lost in the desolate, frozen mountains that it calls home.",
					"{@bold Mysterious Origins.} The circumstances in which the Gargoyle was born is considered a mystery by all, as its unique combination of both draconic and hominid traits is, as far as most are concerned, completely irreproducible. It is heavily speculated that the creature is a half-dragon of sorts, but the manner in which it was conceived is unknown. Nonetheless, the Gargoyle combines the traits of a silverback gorilla and a red dragon to devastating effect. Covered in both the muscular, impenetrable hide of a dragon and the shaggy, warming fur of an ape, the Gargoyle is, for an unknown reason, mostly gray, resembling a stone statue. The only touch of color present on the massive creature is its massive, leathery wings, in which its membrane is a darkened crimson. The Gargoyle earned its name due to these wings, its bestial humanoid physique, the concrete-like appearance of its hide, and its long, dragon-like tail that ends in a devilish point.",
					"{@bold Chimeric Personality.} Similarly to its appearance, the Gargoyle’s personality is tainted by draconic habit. The beast shares a fondness of mountains with its reptilian parent, preferring to lair at high altitudes. It shares a dragon’s greed, collecting trinkets and other items that it considers to be valuable, which are often playthings. It collects wagon wheels, tree trunks, boulders, and even other animals. It’s extremely fond of large grazing animals such as yaks and elk. The Gargoyle is omnivorous, although it prefers to live a more herbivorous lifestyle, grazing with its “troop” and protecting them ferociously. While normally docile and playful, if the Gargoyle encounters anything it perceives as a threat to itself or its troop, it will attack with unexpected levels of primal aggression, combining the blazing fury of a red dragon and the frightening strength of a gorilla. Its mastery of flame surpasses its parent’s, allowing it to wreathe itself in scorching embers."

					"{@bold Radioactive Titan.} Closely related to a smaller genus of innately radioactive spinosaurids, Violothéos has grown to a massive size through unknown means. Some claim that the beast is a close relative of the tarrasque, but given its close ties to a separate, smaller species, it may be safe to assume that this is not the case. It is widely believed that the beast was mutated by overexposure to arcane radiation, which it exerts a peculiar mastery over. Violothéos’ signature weapon is its “atomic breath,” nuclear energy that it generates inside of its body, harnessing electromagnetic force to concentrate it into a laser-like high velocity projectile. The energy is released in the form of a pink radioactive beam, which is capable of melting and vaporizing anything it comes into contact with. Through a similar method, Violothéos can exhale a wave of lethal radiation, irradiating anything it passes through. It is capable of both bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion, although it primarily moves quadrupedally whilst moving terrestrially. Two tusks at the tip of its jaw allow it to grasp and pierce more effectively, along with its peculiar ability to unhinge its jaw similar to a snake. The lizard is naturally immune to extreme heat, cold, radiation, and most forms of conventional weaponry, making it a true force of ultimate calamity. ",

When the planet is faced with global annihilation, the Violothéos will awaken, using its atomic might to topple any foe. When active, Violothéos will remain indifferent to and oftentimes completely ignore all smaller life, regarding them as a warrior would a mere ant. This can prove to be destructive at times, causing Violothéos to lay waste to villages and cities along its journey. ",
					"{@bold Misunderstood Defender.} Oftentimes, a powerful city or hold will use magic to retaliate against Violothéos. While the massive reptile is naturally resistant to the arcane, it is not immune. If sufficiently damaged, Violothéos will defend itself, targeting the attackers and casting them into oblivion with its atomic fury. This usually leads to further destruction, which causes many to resent Violothéos, assuming it to be a malevolent force. This could not be further from the truth, and thus Violothéos lives a very conflicted life, attacked by the very creatures it attempts to defend. ",

They rely on what can only be considered biological machinery to function, as their physiology is extremely complex and borderline unnatural. As a result, these creatures are capable of abilities that appear to be supernatural. Shriekers have two specialized chitinous organs extending from their backs that can emit a cloud of a nontoxic bleaching compound that absorbs direct sunlight, blackening the area around it. This compound spreads through the air like ink in water, blotting out any light in the area. Shriekers use this compound to trap terrified prey in a cloud of darkness, toying with them before ultimately delivering the killing blow with their unusually shaped beaks. These beaks are quite peculiar, consisting of a powerful, armored upper jaw and a much narrower lower jaw that splits into two serrated mandibles when opened fully. It is unknown what the purpose of this adaptation is.",
					"{@bold Forest Dwellers.} Shriekers reside in dense temperate rainforests, claiming massive territories of thick forestland. They prefer areas where the canopy blots out sunlight, darkening the forest floor in a permanent shade of gray. They specialize in preying on skittish creatures, tormenting prey with their multiple adaptations before pouncing on them when they are at their most vulnerable. They prefer to ambush their prey, as they are quite cowardly in a one-on-one fight. By no means does this make them incapable of defending themselves, however, as they are capable of quickly turning the tables on would-be predators when cornered, utilizing their darkening compound to devastating effect. Shriekers are primarily solitary, but occasionally hunt in groups of two or three, although these hunting groups are extremely uncooperative and often form temporarily in order to take down larger prey.",
					"{@bold Sound-Oriented.} Shriekers are known for their incredible mastery of sound, utilizing it for a number of various uses. Shriekers can map the surrounding environment entirely through echolocation, achieving this by opening a flap on the base of their skull, which contains an inner organ that acts similarly to an extremely sensitive eardrum. This enables them to pick up the slightest soundwaves with ease, allowing them to pinpoint the exact location of any sound in the surrounding area. They can produce powerful bursts of ear-piercing noise, shrieking loud enough to deal damage to their surroundings. Perhaps most peculiar, however, is their extended use of infrasound. By emitting inaudibly low frequencies, they can cause extreme paranoia and panic in most organisms, allowing them to trigger an ambush easily. Additionally, they can cause blindness in some creatures and deafen others simply by tampering with chemicals in the victim’s brain. They often provoke hallucinations in their prey, causing affected creatures to see illusionary duplicates of the shrieker that allow it to guide and herd the prey deeper into its hunting grounds."

					"{@italic In the darkest abyssal depths of the sea, a lone, dancing light bobs in the blackness of the void. A lost dolphin, separated from its pod, approaches the light, charmed by its rhythmic movements. Enchanted by the dancing orb, it doesn’t notice as several patches of eerie blue illuminate a massive creature poised directly behind the light. As crackling electricity dances around the bio-luminescent beast, the dolphin is too late to escape as the lure is extinguished and a massive pair of jaws come lunging toward it from the darkness.}",
					"{@bold Darkness Dwellers.} The abyssal-dwelling luminous eel is a massive beast, reaching lengths of 20 feet on average. Most of their lives are spent in the darkest depths of the ocean or in lightless sea caves, hunting anything it perceives to be edible. The eels only venture to the surface twice in their lifetimes, and exclusively during violent oceanic storms. The first journey occurs just after an individual reaches sexual maturity, leading the eels to flock to beaches and coastal habitats in order to breed. It is generally during this event that most attacks occur, as large, dominant males will attack anything that it senses to be a threat. Rival males will strike each other with their long, lashing tails, attempting to knock each other into submission. The victor of these battles will then put on a glorious bio-luminescent display in order to attract a mate. After mating, females will devour the males and remain on the coast before returning to the sea at the storm’s conclusion. Roughly seven to eight months later, the females, having grown even larger than the males at this point in their lives, will return to the beach at which they mated, travelling inland to lay eggs and hunt. They prefer to find places with high levels of static electricity to lay their clutch. After laying, the eels will remain around the coast until the storm ends, at which point they will venture back into the ocean to die. The newborn eels will hatch roughly a week later, returning to the sea in order to begin the cycle anew.",
					"{@bold Electrogenic Hunters:} Luminous eels prefer to hunt similarly to anglerfish, enthralling potential prey with their dancing lure before striking when the target is effectively harmless. The bio-luminescent organs lining their bodies also act similarly to the specialized organs of an electric eel (Main organ, Sachs’ organ, and Hunter’s organ), allowing for electroreception, electrolocation, and, to a much more intense extent, electrocution. The eel channels static electricity via the sodium-potassium exchanger, which maintains a voltage imbalance between the inside of the eel’s cells and their surroundings. The exchanger is said to be “electrogenic” because it removes three sodium ions for every two ions of potassium it allows in. The eel’s bio-luminescent organs have the highest concentration of electrolyte exchangers, with an uneven distribution throughout the rest of its body. Luminous eels have several thousand of these exchanger cells stacked atop one another, capable of a discharge of over 900 V.",
					"{@bold Rogue Males:} When most members of the species are breeding, a select few male individuals will travel too far in search of a mate, eventually getting trapped inland as the storm passes. These rogue males aren’t slaughtered by their mates and are thus left to grow and hunt as they please. These eels lair in coastal caves with various pools of water readily available to allow for easy access to the sea. Transitioning to a more terrestrial lifestyle, these rogue males claim large territories, ranging anywhere from 20 to 40 square miles. They defend these territories ferociously, patrolling them vigilantly. They are nocturnal predators, behaving similarly to will-o-wisps. They will lure unsuspecting travelers and other creatures close enough to be shocked and devoured. In fact, in areas where will-o’-wisps are present, the rogue males will often mistake their lights for a challenging male, charging towards the tiny undead with immense prejudice. "

If a visitor to a forest overseen by a golden stag has a peaceful encounter with the creature, the stag might later come to that visitor's aid, protecting it from predatory animals or rescuing it from some natural hazard. Additionally, the golden stag commands some innate healing ability, using it to heal the sick, wounded, or dying.

As a direct result, venusaurs are only found where sustenance is abundant, and are solitary creatures. Venusaurs are extremely gluttonous creatures, akin to a bear in terms of aggressiveness.

A bond between a druid and a venusaur is special, as both the host and the parasite trust and admire their druid companion, defending them from any perceived threat with extreme hostility. In contrast, nobles will occasionally keep venusaurs as pets to be displayed in their gardens, which more often than not follows with the venusaur devouring all of the noble’s additional plants. Even worse, when the venusaur’s food supply has been depleted in its enclosure, it will use its vines and leaves to tear its way to freedom, searching for more food to devour.

					"{@italic “As molten rock and magma drip from the exposed mouth of the erupting volcano, the village’s inhabitants flee in terror. The local volcano, Mt. Chimney, had shown no recent signs of activity, and its dormancy was a well-known fact. While most villagers fled, screaming and salvaging as little as they could, a select few stood among their burning home, staring up at the mighty volcano. Pointing and yelling, they managed to quell the startled villagers just long enough for them to just barely make out a large winged figure curtained by the ash and smoke. Two powerful wings kept it aloft, beating powerfully as it surveyed its burning surroundings. A burning flame danced atop the end of its long, muscular tail, scorching as brightly and powerfully as it ever had. The people knew this creature. A being, slumbering eternally in the pits of the volcano, a dragon of fire and woe. The false king, Charizard, was here to erase their village from history as punishment for its imprisonment.” – A passage from an Epic, ”The Radiant King”}",
					"Stories such as these are cited frequently when referring to a charizard, although they couldn’t be further from the truth. Charizards are not dragons, although most seem to think so and it isn’t difficult to see why. These reptilian creatures have bright, blazing orange scales decorating a muscular, crocodilian body. A saurian head sits atop a long, veiny neck followed by a set of massive, powerful wings. A lizard-like tail drags along behind it, an everlasting flame perched at its tip.",
					"{@bold Volcano Dwellers.} Charizards are constantly mistaken for true dragons due to their appearance, their magical potential, and their habit of lairing in volcanic regions. A charizard nests deep within the bowels of a volcano, where the temperatures are high enough to burn flesh. While normally solitary, charizards mate for life, often around the age of 40. From there, they raise up to two to three clutches of eggs for the remainder of their lifetimes, which is usually another 70 years. The laid eggs are extremely heat resistant and hatch after about 3 months, resulting in small, theropod-like reptiles known as Combustia salamandra, or charmanders. The two charizards will alternate between which adult will leave the nest to hunt, which occurs about once a week.",
					"{@bold Blazing Predators.} When hunting, charizards will travel up to 30 miles away from their lairs in order to gather food. Being hypercarnivores, charizards prey on anything they can safely scorch from a distance, preferring moderately sized, slow prey that they can pelt with gouts of fire and compressed crescents of razor-sharp wind quickly and without injury. Charizards are not above preying upon humanoids and are intelligent enough to recognize a humanoid dwelling. However, they often stay away from slaying humanoids, as they know revenge bands may form and hunt them down.",
					"{@bold Technical Talents.} From the moment of birth, charizards are born with a wide array of techniques and abilities, making them nearly as versatile as some spellcasters. Adults will nudge their offspring towards their full potential, teaching them to exhale fire and command it along with harness the sky to their whim. It’s heavily speculated that these techniques are a primordial form of spellcasting, making charizards one of the most ancient species on the planet. Their full array of abilities is yet to be documented, but from what is understood, they are capable of conjuring meteors from the heavens, directing the wind and sky, transforming and altering flame to fit their needs, conjuring barriers of force, and altering their own molecular composition to better suit their situation.",
					"{@bold Flaming Fury:} Charizards fear humanoids for one reason: they are smart enough to plan and malicious enough to vow revenge. Charizards, too, are capable of revenge, and if a Charizard were to return from a hunt to a slain mate and hatchlings, it will fly into an overwhelming rage. Without thinking, it will journey to the nearest humanoid city or town and envelop it in mourning flames. When wounded, it will channel the radiant energy of the stars, being suddenly enveloped by a ball of flame and gas, which bursts outwards into a swath of brilliant celestial light. Trading its orange hide for one of endless darkness, deep blue flames spill from the sides of its jaws in a blazing inferno. As the hottest star burns twice as bright, it also burns half as long. Siphoning its own life force to enhance its attacks, a charizard only enters this form when it is hellbent on putting an end to whatever unfortunate soul decided to wound it so."

From the bushes, a pair of cat-like eyes focus on the creature as a leopard prepares to pounce. As a felid scream erupts from the tree line, a powerful blast of water slams into the predator with such force to immediately send it sprawling backwards several feet. From the water, a massive snapping turtle rises from the surface, taking several hulking steps towards the small turtle. Two massive cannons of metallic carapace sprout from underneath its thick, spiked shell, dripping with water as thick clouds of water vapor puff from the barrels. }",
					"Hulking, powerful reptiles with an affinity for water, blastoises are massive bipedal snapping turtles with two chitinous cannons, called “geysers,” extending from their shoulder blades, both of which are capable of producing powerful gouts of water that can easily punch through steel.",
					"{@bold Water Lovers.} Out of all the amphibious creatures, none feel more at home in the water than a blastoise. Adapted to surviving in freshwater, saltwater, and anything in between, blastoises can be found wherever a body of water is nearby. Like most reptiles, they enjoy basking atop of rocks, soaking in the sun’s rays. Being the usual apex predator in an aquatic ecosystem, these massive turtles oftentimes bully even the most massive crocodiles into sharing their basking spots, and it isn’t uncommon to find a blastoise basking on the shore with a group of uncomfortable crocodiles. ",
					"{@bold Familial Reptiles.} Blastoises are extremely sociable creatures, preferring to create large family units, called nests. These nests are not confined to being of the same species, and most will consist of various creatures an individual blastoise has claimed or adopted over the course of its extensively long lifespan. For some odd reason, each creature in a nest seems to genuinely care and appreciate one another, no matter its individual species’ natural intelligence or lack thereof. As a result, nests can consist of natural predators and prey resting next to one another in a bundle of familial affection. While extremely friendly, blastoises are vastly protective over members of their nest and will not hesitate to blast a hole through any creature looking to prey on one of its “hatchlings,” be it a small insect or an ancient dragon.",
					"{@bold Draconic Roots.} It has been speculated that blastoises share their roots with dragon turtles, given that both share a primordial intelligence and a similar overall appearance, although blastoises are often seen walking bipedally in contrast to the quadripedal locomotion of a dragon turtle. Additionally, their geysers may be a form of breath weapon, which would explain their seemingly magical ability to fire an infinite amount of water at such powerful pressures. Perhaps also their frightening ability to nearly triple in size when enraged can be attributed to draconic power. While oftentimes most interactions between two blastoises are friendly, involving a playful headbutt and an affectionate water squirt, occasionally two members will engage in an all-out war, usually when a member of one blastoise’s nest preys on a member of another. Bloodied and beaten, the two blastoises will surge with powerful, electrifying energy, expelling a massive blast of heated air before erupting to the size of mountains. The two blastoises will wrestle with one another, often wreaking havoc on the terrain around them before one or both is knocked out. Even after such an intense battle, the two blastoises will regard each other as good friends if they are ever to meet again."

The Irukandji jellyfish's stings are so severe that they often cause fatal brain hemorrhages and are the cause of over 600 deaths annually. Very little is truly known about the Irukandji, as it is an extremely small and fragile animal. However, they are known for causing an effect known as Irukandji syndrome in victims should they ever recover."

The name instead refers to its extremely potent venom, which it delivers copious amounts of when threatened. While this reptile resides in arid, desert-like badlands, unfortunate travelers may accidentally encounter it and provoke its toxic bite.

					"{@i I can’t stop repeating these three words in my mind, testing them, rearranging them, trying desperately to find a meaning. What do these words mean? What am I meant to slay? Vecna, perhaps? It’s likely, given the ‘nature’ of my divine vision. But I fear I’m failing him. Kama’hu, I mean. Last night’s vision was worrying, and I must return to the village at once. What if something awful has happened? Whilst within Kama’hu’s realm, he sounded terrified and weak, as if he was struggling against an overwhelming foe. The moon, his eye, it was not his own. It was that wretched green slit beaming down at me, enveloping me in an eerie light. I wanted to run, I wanted to hide, but I couldn’t move. There was something so bone-chillingly captivating about that damned eye, and I can’t place my claw upon it. As I stared into it, falling deeper and deeper into its malevolent gaze, the earth gave way, sending me plummeting into the darkness below. As I peered down, a colossal reptilian maw opened wide before me, exhaling a noxious green smo- By the gods, that’s it! The maw belonged to that monstrous dragon that bested me at the greedy satyr’s estate, I just know it! I should have recognized the sickening smell of rot and death, but I was enveloped by the toothed jaws before I could properly register what was unfolding. As I fell deeper and deeper into the massive beast’s maw, Kama’hu’s voice echoed within my head, relaying to me those cryptic words;} {@b ‘Slay. Survive. Reclaim.’}",
					"{@i Now that I truly have a moment to think about it, I suppose I know what I must do. I knew I would have to face that wretched monster and his winged snake one day, but I was hoping it wouldn’t be so soon. But, perhaps, this time it will be different. I have something that money and power can’t buy, something that has felled every foe that dared stand against me; I have friends. No, family. I have family that will stand beside me no matter where I go or whatever I choose to hunt. Alone, I was weak. Together, we are strong.}",
					"{@i Perhaps, though, the situation is more dire than I had hoped. Something is wrong. Earlier, just moments after I awoke, I wandered outside. Recently, Julia has undergone a change of sorts, and I am beyond worried for her. I know it may have been wrong of me to leave her alone for the time being, but I needed to feel the warm, tropical winds of the ocean, smell the salt of the sea, and let my scales soak in the pale, refreshing moonlight. As I sat, staring and pondering, something peculiar occurred. Without warning, my right claw began to emit dancing wisps of light that flickered up my arm, as if I had begun the process of wild shaping accidentally. Curious and concerned, I watched, waiting for the familiar feeling of my form shifting into something greater. However, instead of changing, my arm began to slowly disintegrate, unraveling into flowing, weaving shimmers of blue-green radiance. Alarmed, I leapt back, but the process continued. The wisps of light began dancing and flickering around me, creating a display similar to the Sky Lights of the North and South; similar to Kama’hu’s incorporeal form.}",
					"{@i Concerned, but reassured, I stood, watching as the lights swam and swayed around me. However, when it began to near my neck and head, I lost my nerve, clawing at the effect with my remaining hand. As my claws made contact with the phenomena, they, too, began to unravel, causing me to panic. I desperately tried willing it to regress, as if it were like the rest of my abilities. Summoning all of my willpower, I began to concentrate on ending it like I would end a beast shape. This, however, simply made matters far worse. As I began focusing on the shapes of beasts I had once seen, I began to sporadically warp and change, transforming into various creatures at random. Dragons, wolves, yetis, a monstrous snake-like beast, every aspect of my body began to shift erratically, transmuting me into something horrendous and unnatural. Bones jutted out at irregular angles, jaws formed and screamed in places they did not belong, entire organisms began to sprout from my flesh, clawing for escape before being forcefully pulled back into my body. I was terrified, I wasn’t sure of what to do. The agony of it all was unbearable. I was wracked with pain, too much to move or scream, leaving me to stand and struggle. I was not ready to die, but I feared that I had no choice, consumed by the very creatures I reigned over.}",
					"{@i Suddenly, I was alone again, years ago, the sole survivor of my party. I was face-to-face with one of the largest reptiles I had ever seen, and I was prepared to fight to the death. The crocodile, however, gazed at me, its sharp, predatory eyes flashing a brilliant orange. Before me, it warped and changed, dissolving just like I had, transforming into Kama’hu, Lord of Primal Fury. That night was the most important in my life. It had changed me for the greater, gifting me with a purpose other than survival. Kama’hu bestowed upon me two gifts that day; the power to command the wilds and the power to feel as others could. As I revisited the events of that night, it occurred to me that perhaps this is what Kama’hu was telling me, that I had to calm myself and think like I had that night when I had confronted him. I did so, and almost immediately, the screams ceased. Gradually, my flesh began to piece back together, the churning lights slowing and reforming into my body. The rapid transmutation began to end, the howling forms of the wilds returning to dormancy as I slowly originated to my standard shape. As the last of the lights finally faded, I let out a hiss of relief. I had managed to survive the greatest horror of my short life. Calmly, I walked back into the estate, giving one last nod of thanks to the moon, sea, and sky before turning to leave.}",
					"{@i When I returned, Julia had stolen most of the Rat Pack. They laid atop her, cuddling against one another to provide warmth. Dirk, too, laid next to Julia, snoring quietly. A sense of satisfaction washed over me as I gazed upon them. ‘This is what is truly important,’ I had thought. As I finish writing this, thin wisps of light periodically trail up and down my scales, but I am content with it. I know now how to command and control it, and I will not fail Kama’hu with the newfound blessing he gifted me with. While I’m not entirely certain why I was chosen over anyone else, I will hold my objections until dawn. For now, this is Kizar, King of Beasts, signing off.}",

							"As our vessel crashed through yet another destructive wave, a number of the men started screaming and pointing at something in the sky. Looking up at it, I- Gods alive… Long, dark tentacles dangled from the sky as something descended from the rolling storm above. Lightning flashed, and the silhouette of a squid-like monster was illuminated by the flaring light. Its tendrils coiled around various members of the crew as an electric roar echoed louder than thunder. Hemmins, Jackson, Cathaway… it ate them. It ate them all."

					"Louder than thunder and more potent than lightning, the Kraken is a monstrous colossal squid that developed a destructive bond with the Elemental Plane of Air, harnessing the soul of the storm to wreak havoc on unsuspecting ships. Like its rival and nemesis, the White Whale, the Kraken exclusively preys on the flesh of humanoids, preferring the taste of sentient flesh and blood to anything else. On clear, sunny days, the Kraken drifts underneath the waves, submerged, scanning the horizon for evidence of humanoid presence. When lighting crackles through the air and the clouds are thick and dark, the Kraken rises up, hiding in the clouds and pulling sailors, pirates, and even entire ships into the sky to be crushed and devoured."
